                    <h3>Ysabel Bautista</h3><br>
                    <p> The presentation of these french fries was immaculate and very handy. The box was the perfect
                        size to fit into a cup holder for on-the-go access. The french fry itself was the perfect size
                        in that it was very thick and dense. Ideal for supporting any condiments that you wish to add.

                    <h3>Samantha Aniversario</h3><br>
                    <p>When we first tried the fries, we were immediately taken aback. They were not only the perfect
                        amount of salt and potato; they were GODLY. We had a moment of silence to take in what we had
                        just consumed. The price was around 100 pesos, which also surprised us the most because, for
                        this quality, the price seemed lower than what it actually should have been. Walang sinabi ung
                        potato corner!</p>
